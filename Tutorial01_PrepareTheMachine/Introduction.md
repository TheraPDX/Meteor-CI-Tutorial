##  Prepare the Machine

These scripts will get you started easily with: package development, testing, documenting, logging, code style linting and more, all on a platform of continuous integration, delivery and deployment.

This first script, run with . . .
```ruby
sudo ./Tutorial01_PrepareTheMachine.sh
```
. . . sets up all necessary preconditions for the remaining scripts.  As much as possible, this first step handles all tasks that require root access.

You can hit the 'a' key at any of the pause points to have it run **a**ll the remaining steps without further interruption.

(Yes, ```apt-get update``` does get called too often; but the point is to show each step separately and clearly.)
