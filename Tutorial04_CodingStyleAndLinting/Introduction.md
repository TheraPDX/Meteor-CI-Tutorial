## Code Quality - Coding Style and Linting

These scripts will get you started easily with Meteor package development, testing, documenting, logging, code style linting and continuous deployment.

The previous script, 'Tutorial03_UnitTestAPackage.sh', got us started with a package, stored and controlled independantly, yet one that can still be edited and tested as though it was part of an app anyway.

This one . . .  
```terminal
./Tutorial04_CodingStyleAndLinting.sh
```
. . .  brings in the capability of applying code style and quality rules: while editing, before committing and during continuous deployment.

This is useful for an individual developer, but increases in importance with the number of developers involved.
