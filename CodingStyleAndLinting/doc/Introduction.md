## Code Quality - Coding Style and Linting

These scripts will get you started easily with Meteor package development, testing, documenting, code style linting and continuous integration.

The previous script, 'Part03_UnitTestAPackage.sh', got us started with a package stored and controlled independantly, yet that can be edited and tested as though it was part of an app.

This one . . .  
```terminal
Part04_CodingStyleAndLinting.sh
```
. . .  brings in the capability of applying code style and quality rules while editing, just before committing and during continuous integration.

This is useful for an individual developer, but greatly increases in importance with the number of developers involved.
