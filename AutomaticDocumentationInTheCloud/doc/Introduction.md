## Code Quality - Automatic Documentation in the Cloud

These scripts will get you started easily with Meteor package development, testing, documenting, code style linting and continuous integration.

The previous script, 'Part04_CodingStyleAndLinting.sh', set up code quality assurance. 

This one . . .  
```terminal
./Part05_AutomaticDocumentationInTheCloud.sh
```
. . . continues the componentization efforts of earlier parts, by making it very easy to document the code and the tests of each package as it is developed.
