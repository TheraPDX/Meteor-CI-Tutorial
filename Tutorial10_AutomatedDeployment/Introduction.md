## Automated Deployment

In this final section of the current version of this tutorial series, we learn about deploying a Meteor application, including building for Android and, *for simplicity*, serving it out of the web hosted application. The volatility of Google's procedures for serving the app from the *Play Store* will quickly make obsolete anything we'd show here, so we won't go into it. 

We use our understanding of manual deployment to complete our CI script to do it all automatically in CircleCI, every time we push a commit to GitHub.

Get started now by running ...
```terminal
./Tutorial10_AutomatedDeployment.sh
```
