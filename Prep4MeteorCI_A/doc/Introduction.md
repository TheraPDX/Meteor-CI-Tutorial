These scripts prepare the way for you to get started easily with Meteor package development, testing, documenting, code style linting and continuous integration

They are designed for a small (10GB) Xubuntu 14.04 virtual machine. They have not been tested in any other environment since the idea is to provide clear proven instructions that can be adapted easily to other circumstances.

Except where indicated, the scripts are 'idempotent' -- you can run them repeatedly without adverse consequences.

The first script 'Prep4MeteorCI_A.sh' sets up all necessary preconditions for the second script.

The second one 'Prep4MeteorCI_B.sh' takes you  through the entire process of preparing a Meteor project and package with  all the previously mentioned application development support tools.
