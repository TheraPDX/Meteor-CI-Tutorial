These scripts will get you started easily with Meteor package development, testing, documenting, code style linting and continuous integration.

The previous script, 'Step02_UnitTestThePackage.sh', set up necessary preconditions for the second script, basically all tasks that require root access. 

This one, 'Step02_UnitTestThePackage.sh', prepares a Meteor project with an embedded package ready for testing with TinyTest using the first few of the previously mentioned application development support tools.

You should not need to use 'sudo' for this or any of the later parts.  Everything should happen in your HOME directory.
