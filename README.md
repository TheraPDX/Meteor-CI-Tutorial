# Meteor-CI-Tutorial

I call this an "executable slide show". It does most of the work for you, but in about 100 small steps with all the source code for each step.
The topics covered are :

    Docker
    Xubuntu
    Bash
    X2GO
    SSH
    Meteor (and synchronous JavaScript)
    NodeJS (and asynchronous JavaScript)
    Swagger
    Selenium
    Nightwatch
    Bunyan
    esLint
    jsDoc
    Git
    GitHub
    CircleCI
    AndroidSDK

When you're done with the tutorial you'll have a complete cloud-smart development environment with a web app, a cellphone app, a project documentation site, version control in the cloud, unit testing, functional testing, code style monitoring, continuous integration and deployment. Rather than drown you in text, there's a video of each part that shows every action you have to take.
