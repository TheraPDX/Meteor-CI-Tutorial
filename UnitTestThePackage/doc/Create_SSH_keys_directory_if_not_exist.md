#### Create SSH keys directory if it does not exist.
 
This script requires you to have an SSH private key!

If the file '~/.ssh/id_rsa' exists, then this command group will do nothing.

Otherwise, it will set up the directory and create an empty '~/.ssh/id_rsa' 

You'll need to paste your SSH credentials into each of the empty files. This assumes you only need to copy them in from some other GitHub project.  Getting them for the first time is beyond the scope of this tutorial.  You should follow [GitHub's getting started documents.](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)
