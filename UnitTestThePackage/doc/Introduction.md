These scripts will get you started easily with Meteor package development, testing, documenting, code style linting and continuous integration.

The previous script, 'Step01_PrepareTheMachine.sh', set up necessary preconditions for the second script, basically all tasks that require root access. 

This one, 'Step02_UnitTestThePackage.sh', prepares an actual Meteor project and package with all the previously mentioned application development support tools.

You should not need to use 'sudo' for this part.  Everything should happen in your HOME diectory.
