These scripts prepare the way for you to get started easily with Meteor package development, testing, documenting, code style linting and continuous integration

The previous script, 'Prep4MeteorCI_A.sh', prepared a virtual machine with the system wide requirements for continuous integration with Meteor.

This one, 'Prep4MeteorCI_B.sh', prepares an actual Meteor project and package with all the previously mentioned application development support tools.

You should not need to use 'sudo' for this part.  Everything should happen in your HOME diectory.
