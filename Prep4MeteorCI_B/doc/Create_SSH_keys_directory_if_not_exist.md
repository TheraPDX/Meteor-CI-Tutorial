#### Create SSH keys directory if it does not exist.
 
This script requires you to have an SSH private key!

If the file '~/.ssh/id_rsa' exists, then this command group will do nothing.

Otherwise, it will set up the directory and create an empty '~/.ssh/id_rsa' 

You'll need to paste your SSH credentials into each of the empty files
