## Version Control In The Cloud

These scripts will get you started easily with Meteor package development, testing, documenting, code style linting and continuous integration.

The previous script, 'Part01_PrepareTheMachine.sh', set up necessary preconditions for the remaining scripts, (basically all tasks that require root access). 

This one . . .  
```terminal
./Part02_VersionControlInTheCloud.sh
```
. . . prepares a Meteor project, with version control *in the cloud* in GitHub.  You will need to understand a bit about Public and Private Keys and about Secure Shell.  Try reading <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/" target="_blank">GitHub's getting started documents.</a>

You should not need to use 'sudo' for this or any of the later parts.  In other words, everything should happen in subdirectories of your HOME directory.
