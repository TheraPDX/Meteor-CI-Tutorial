## Package Self Test

A major benefit of freely publishing a useful package is the feedback and collaboration that can come back to you.  However, the quality of your code, documention and tests, can convince or repel would-be contributors. If I can fork your repo, push it to continuous integration and see it thoroughly tested and see its documentation generated without intervention, I will be confident that ÃŒ can contribute easily to an enduring project.

In this step we will finalize our code annotations, automate running and verifying the usage example and then complete our ```circle.yml``` file so that documentation generation and the verfication of usage examples all run automatically in CircleCI.

Get started now by running ...
```terminal
./Tutorial09_PackageSelfTest.sh
```
