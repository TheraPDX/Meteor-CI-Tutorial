These scripts will get you started easily with Meteor package development, testing, documenting, code style linting and continuous integration.

This first script, run with . . .  
```terminal
sudo ./Step01_PrepareTheMachine.sh
```
. . . sets up all necessary preconditions for the second script.  As much as possible, this first step handles all tasks that require root access.

You can hit the 'a' key at any of the pause points to have it run **a**ll the remaining steps without further interruption.

(Yes, ```apt-get update``` gets called too often; the point is to show each step separately and clearly.)
