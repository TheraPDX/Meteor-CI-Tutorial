These scripts will get you started easily with Meteor package development, testing, documenting, code style linting and continuous integration

This first script, 'Step01_PrepareTheMachine.sh', sets up all necessary preconditions for the second script.  As much as possible, this first step handles all tasks that require root access.

You can hit the 'a' key at any of the pause points to have it run **a**ll the remaining steps without further interruption.
